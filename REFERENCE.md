## Classes

### xfce

This is very simple and at the moment only sets up the base xfce4

#### Examples

##### Basic usage

```puppet
include xfce
```

##### Ensure the display manager service `lightdm` is setup _after_ xfce

```puppet
class { 'xfce ':
  display_manager => 'lightdm',
}
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `xfce` class.

##### `display_manager`

Data type: `String`

If set, and a service exists in the catalog by the same name, then XFCE will be installed _before_ that service. This may avoid having
to restart the display manager after installing XFCE.

Default value: ''
